# Shell-for-linux
Implement a command line interpreter (i.e., shell). The shell should display a user prompt, for example: Shell>, at which a user can enter for example, ls -l command, as follows: Shell> ls -l. Next, your shell creates a child process to execute this command. Finally, when its execution is finished, it prompts for the next command from the user.
